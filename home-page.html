            <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free
              society, transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of
              how
              citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
              transparent.</p>
            <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
              and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
              and
              just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what
              their
              Government is doing.
            </p>
            <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
              effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
              our
              site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
            <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use.
              We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to
                  public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                  attack on
                  absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                  legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                  then
                  included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                  constitution
                  (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
                  related
                  to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.</p>

                <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                  freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom
                  of the
                  press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to
                  row back
                  on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers,
                  Bentham,
                  Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and
                  is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to
                  have
                  adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to
                  the
                  eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in
                  1917,
                  passing its Act Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                  Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
